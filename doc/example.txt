It provides features for chaining LLM calls, managing conversational memory, and integrating external data sources.

Streamlit is an open-source Python framework for creating interactive web apps for data science and machine learning. 
It allows developers to build UIs quickly and easily without needing frontend experience.

FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. 
It is often used to build vector databases for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

Sentence Transformers (SBERT) are models for converting text into embeddings (vectors) that capture semantic meaning. 
They are used for search, clustering, and semantic similarity tasks.
